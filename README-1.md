# This is a project report of my implementation of  Project 14 PBL at Darey.io ( Experience Continuous Integration With Jenkins | Ansible | Artifactory | Sonarqube | PHP)
##  This project features the practical use of Jenkins, Ansible, Artifactory, Sonarqube in the deployment of PHP(todo) Application.


### ABOUT PROJECT 14
> while implementing this project, the major concern  about this project is 'Dependencies in the softwares and modules and software version compatibility. as at this date 11th july, 2023. every version specified in the project guide must be adhere to strictly while focusing on the goal 9of becoming a DevOps Engineer of a note.

**Background knowledge / CI/CD concept learnt:**
> Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice of merging all developersâ€™ working copies to a shared mainline (e.g., Git Repository or some other version control system) several times per day. Frequent merges reduce chances of any conflicts in code and allow to run tests more often to avoid massive rework if something goes wrong. This principle can be formulated as Commit early, push often.
> before we talk about Continous Delivery there is a process or work flow which is 
 1. Performing test locally (unit test),
 2. Compiling code in the CI environment
 3. Conduct further test in CI environment
 4. Deploy the artifact(tested app) from the CI to Production environment for users

> CD on the other hand is Continuous Delivery which ensures that software checked into the mainline is always ready to be deployed to users. The deployment here is manually triggered after certain QA tasks are passed successfully. There is another CD known as Continuous Deployment which is also about deploying the software to the users, but rather than manual, it makes the entire process fully automated. Thus, Continuous Deployment is just one step ahead in automation than Continuous Delivery.
